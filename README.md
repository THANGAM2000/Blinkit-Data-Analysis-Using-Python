# 📊 Blinkit Data Analysis Using Python

This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Blinkit (formerly Grofers) data using Python. The goal is to uncover insights from the dataset using powerful data manipulation and visualization libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Blinkit_Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📌 Key Steps in the Analysis

1. **Data Loading**:  
   Loaded dataset from a local CSV file using `pandas.read_csv`.

2. **Initial Exploration**:  
   Used `.head()`, `.tail()`, and `.shape` to get a basic overview of the data.

3. **Data Cleaning** *(if applicable)*:  
   - Checked for missing values  
   - Handled duplicates and outliers  
   - Converted data types as necessary

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Visualized trends and patterns using various plots  
   - Used `seaborn` and `matplotlib` for detailed charting  
   - Analyzed product categories, pricing, frequency, etc.

5. **Insights**:  
   The analysis revealed key trends such as most popular products, seasonal changes, price distribution, and user behavior (details inside the notebook).

## 📸 Sample Visuals

Plots include:
- Bar charts of top-selling items
- Distribution of product prices
- Category-wise analysis
- Heatmaps and correlation matrices (if included)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository  
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter or VSCode  
3. Ensure you have the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
   ```
4. Run the cells sequentially

## 📂 Data

The dataset file used (`blinkit_data.csv`) must be placed in the appropriate path as specified in the notebook:
```python
df = pd.read_csv("/Users/tgm/Downloads/blinkit_data.csv")
```
You may need to update the path depending on your system.

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Use Plotly for interactive visualizations  
- Deploy insights as a dashboard using Streamlit or Dash  
- Incorporate machine learning for demand prediction
